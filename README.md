## Description
**Nerdy Nomad** is a resource app helping Users connect with a science center in all 50 United States (and DC). Users can create profiles--secured by Authentication--then comment and rate science centers they have visited. Users get a Nerd Rating based on the number of science centers they've visited, and a Nomad Rating based on the number of states they've visited. If their Nerd and Nomad ratings are sufficiently high, Users can earn the *Nerdy Nomad* badge and display it on their profile!
